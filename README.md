# TechgunsExampleAddon
Example Addon for Techguns 1.12

This is a simple example on how to make an addon to Techguns by adding a new armor and a laserpistol

You need to add Techguns to your forge workspace by either downloading the jar and manually adding it or using curseforge as maven repository and download techguns from there with gradle. 

This example is based on Techguns 2.0.1.3_pre2 (https://github.com/pWn3d1337/Techguns2/releases/tag/2.0.1.3_pre2) and at least this version or newer is required as some things where fixed/added to Techguns to make it possible.

If you are new to minecraft forge modding refer to the forge documentation and general modding tutorials first.

The example is simple and uses many existing Techguns objects, but a lot of stuff like models/projectiles can be changed by subclassing existing techguns classes. If you need more examples, look at the Techguns source.
